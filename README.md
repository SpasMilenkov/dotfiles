A repo holding my various configs


## Stuff I use

[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/): The terminal I use as it supports heavy customization (when you actually want to customize it)

[Nala](https://gitlab.com/volian/nala): Prettier UI for apt :)

[FastFetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch): Pretty print when you boot up the terminal (RIP Neofetch)

[Starship](https://starship.rs/): Pretty file paths in the terminal

[direnv](https://direnv.net/): Injects variables from the environment. Really helps with .env files
